          <h1>DMRESTRequest</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><strong>DMRESTRequest</strong> is a super simple wrapper around <strong>NSURLConnection</strong> and <strong>NSMutableRequest</strong>. 
It's allow you to launch REST Requests to your server in 2 line, literally. </p>

<p>It's built using <strong>ARC</strong> and targeted for iOS 5 and later, Mac OSX Snow Leopard and later. </p>

<p>I wrote it as an highly re-usable class, you are invited to customize it to make it fit in your client/server implementation.</p>

<p>This is not a framework nor complete solution like RESTKit is. </p>

<p><strong>DMRESTRequest</strong> is a utility I wrote mostly because all other frameworks was doing too much  for my need. It is aim to do simple REST Request to a server without object mapping, network management, queuing etc...</p>

<p>Also, DMRESTRequest is especially targeted for server that send back response as JSON but can be used of other response format too. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ol>
<li>Support 2 way of executing a request, using block or delegate. </li>
<li>Super simple to instantiate, you have to pass the <strong>HTTP</strong> method you want to use, the targeted <strong>ressource</strong> and the <strong>parameters</strong> as a dictionary <code>key=value</code>
</li>
<li>The class take care of building the appropriate request and the parameters data. </li>
<li>Response trough a delegate (also works for blocks) method when no active internet connection is available. No Reachbility needed. </li>
<li>Work with the status bar activity indicator. </li>
<li>I've wrote a little category to encode the parameters string in UTF-8 and escape it. It is included as <strong>DMRESTRequest</strong> use it. </li>
<li>Automatic parameters converstion to JSON format for HTTPBody if needed. </li>
<li>Basic HTTP auth support. </li>
</ol><h2>What you should know before using it</h2>

<h3>Constants</h3>

<p>You have to edit 2 constants, in <strong>DMRESTRequest</strong>, your <code>API_URL</code> and <code>FILE_EXT</code>. Those constants represent your server endpoint and the file extensions you use (ie .json).
URL string is constructed like this <code>API_URL/ressource.FILE_EXT?parameters</code></p>

<h3>Timeout</h3>

<p>Default <code>Timeout</code> interval is 60 seconds You can you can set:  <code>request.timeout = 30</code>.</p>

<h3>Sending parameters as JSON</h3>

<p>For automatic parameters conversion to JSON format for HTTPBody just set <code>request.sendJSON = YES</code> before executing the request.
It will automagically convert your parameters to a JSON string and set thr HTTP stuff like <code>application/json</code>. (Useful for RAILS REST service for example)</p>

<h3>HTTP header fields</h3>

<p>The standard HTTP content-type is hardcoded to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, you're free to make it dynamic if you need a custom one. But for most/all of your requests it should works. </p>

<h3>Custom HTTP header fields</h3>

<p>With the property <code>HTTPHeaderFields</code> you can overwrite the default HTTP header fields by yours. Once this property is modified DMRestRequest will not add any extra parameters itself. So you have to take care of everythings. </p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>This is a really simple set of classes, ready to use, just import <strong>DMRESTRequest</strong>, and <strong>NSString+TotalEscaping</strong> in your project, import <strong>DMRESTRequest.h</strong>  where you wan to make requests and you're done. </p>

<h2>Code example</h2>

<p>You will find more detailled examples in the project... </p>

<h3>using block method</h3>

<pre><code> DMRESTRequest *blockrestRequest = [[DMRESTRequest alloc]initWithMethod:@"GET" 
                                                        ressource:@"users"
                                                       parameters:[NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"Dimillian" forKey:@"user"] 
                                                shouldEscapeParameters:YES];
[blockrestRequest executeBlockRequest:^(NSURLResponse *response, NSData *data, NSError *error, BOOL success){
    if (error || !success) {
        //TODO show error message
    }
    else{
        //TODO do something with response
    }
}]; 
</code></pre>

<h3>using delegate</h3>

<pre><code>-(void)requestDidStart
{

}

-(void)requestDidRespondWithHTTPStatus:(NSInteger)status
{

}

-(void)requestDidFinishWithJSON:(NSJSONSerialization *)json
{

}

-(void)requestDidFailWithError:(NSError *)error
{

}

-(void)requestDidFailBecauseNoActiveConnection
{

}

-(void)requestCredentialIncorrectForHTTPAuth
{

}
</code></pre>

<h2>How to enhance it ?</h2>

<p>Here is a few points you should take into considerations to make this class better.</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a method to inject your <strong>OAUTH</strong> token within <strong>DMRESTRequest</strong>
</li>
<li>Make it more HTTP compliant. Support custom content type. </li>
<li>Create your own JSON parsers and create your own model to match your server implementation and make them works with this class. </li>
</ol><h2>Licensing</h2>
